# Bellatrix

The software program Bellatrix was developed for iGEM 2020. Bellatrix is a software written in Python, designed to download and organized customized libraries of PDB (Protein Data Bank) data. 

Bellatrix formats PDB data into novel file type called a Star file. See the attached image for the anatomy of a Star file. A Star file is a .csv that contains matrices of vectors, where each vector is the vector from one alphacarbon to another. 

See the Bellatrix.py file for indepth instruction on how to operate Bellatrix.
